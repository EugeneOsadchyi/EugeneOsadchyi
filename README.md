# Eugene Osadchyi 🇺🇦

Greetings! I am Eugene, a Full Stack Developer from Ukraine with over 9 years of experience in the web development.
Over my career, I had a change to gain a commercial-experience in Perl, Ruby, JavaScript and Elixir.
And I have built several long-term commercial projects using commonly used Ruby on Rails, React.js, Express.js and Phoenix.

On my last job, I worked with a team of talented folks
([@Light-Keeper](https://github.com/Light-Keeper) 🧐, [@biggless](https://github.com/biggless) 🦄, [@dpochapskyi](https://github.com/dpochapskyi) 🎾),
were we were building highly intensive microservices from scratch,supported their a full development life-cycle,
monitored their health and performance, were regular On-Call.

We used a Continuous Deployment 🚀 model with only 1 QA.

Over this 4,5 years, we have built a number of successful integrations,
among which were integrations with Jira Server, Jira Cloud, Zendesk, DataDog, SalesForce, ServiceNow and AWS.

Right now, I am OPEN for New Opportunities, and I would like to find a challenging project which I will really ENJOY! ❤️
My SKILLS 💪 will help your team to be succeed! 🤜🤛
